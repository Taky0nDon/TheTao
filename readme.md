# Random Tao Generator

# UPDATE: GUI ADDED
## In order to run the proper program, run gui.py. main.py is now deprecated.


The goal of this program is to facilitate meditating upon various verses of
the *Tao Te Ching*. Eventually, it will generate a random verse for the user
to ponder. At the moment, all it does is allow verses to be added to a JSON
database. When ran, the user will enter each line of the verse one at a time, and
after entering the last line, they will enter "end" in order to terminate the string,
and have the verse added to the JSON file.
